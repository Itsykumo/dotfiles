# Sean's Dotfiles

Not using it anymore these days as I have switched to PC for my main development environment.

## Getting Started
I included a bash script to help me transfer the files and settings to the user home directory

```bash
./setup fresh
```
If you messed up the setting, to re-setup:
```bash
./setup
```
